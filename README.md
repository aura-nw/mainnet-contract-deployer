# Mainnet Contract Deployer Service

This is a service to help end-users deploy their contract from Euphoria Staging Network to Mainnet.

## Main flow

There are 2 steps to deploy contract(s) to Mainnet:

- From our AuraScan site, user choose contract(s) that have been verified and request to deploy contract(s)'s `Code ID` to Mainnet.
- From this service site, our admin will review each request and decide whether approve or reject the request. If approved, your contract(s)'s Code ID from Euphoria will be stored on Mainnet and an email with the new Code ID(s) on Mainnet will be sent to your requested email. If rejected, an email with rejection reason will be sent to your requested email.
